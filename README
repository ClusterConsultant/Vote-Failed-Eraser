This disables the CallVoteFailed element and the vote_failed.wav noise. Made for Pazer 
as part of the TF2 Bot Detector project by ClusterConsultant and Moeb with <3.

This will reset all voting related UI elements to default. This is unavoidable as the 
way TF2 loads custom requires that the entire file be present so one could not just 
override the vote failed related parts. If you want your custom HUD to still apply 
to the voting ui simply copy your `custom/exampleHUD/resource/ui/votehud.res` to the 
`custom/aaaaaaaaa_votefailed_eraser_v2/hud_override` folder.

Or just run `hudfix.bat`
